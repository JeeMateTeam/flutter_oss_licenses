# flutter_oss_licenses

## Introduction

[flutter_oss_licenses](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_oss_licenses) is a tool to generate detail and better OSS license list using `pubspec.yaml/lock` files.

Unlike the package name, it still runs with pure Dart environment :)

## Installing

Adding the package name to `dev_dependencies`; not to `dependencies` because the package does nothing on runtime.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_oss_licenses: ^3.0.2
```

## Generate oss_licenses.dart

Before executing the command, you must update your `pubspec.lock` using `pub get` (or `pub upgrade` if you want).

```shell
flutter pub get
```

And then, the following command generates `oss_licenses.dart` on the project's `lib/` directory:

```shell
flutter pub run flutter_oss_licenses:generate.dart
```

The following fragment is just a part of generated `lib/oss_licenses.dart`:

```dart
const allDependencies = <Package>[
  _args,
  _collection,
  _dart_pubspec_licenses,
  _flutter_lints,
  _json_annotation,
  _lints,
  _meta,
  _path,
  _source_span,
  _string_scanner,
  _term_glyph,
  _yaml
];

/// Direct `dependencies`.
const dependencies = <Package>[
  _args,
  _dart_pubspec_licenses,
  _meta,
  _path,
  _yaml
];

/// Direct `dev_dependencies`.
const devDependencies = <Package>[
  _flutter_lints
];

/// Package license definition.
class Package {
  /// Package name
  final String name;
  /// Description
  final String description;
  /// Website URL
  final String? homepage;
  /// Repository URL
  final String? repository;
  /// Authors
  final List<String> authors;
  /// Version
  final String version;
  /// License
  final String? license;
  /// Whether the license is in markdown format or not (plain text).
  final bool isMarkdown;
  /// Whether the package is included in the SDK or not.
  final bool isSdk;
  /// Direct dependencies
  final List<Package> dependencies;

  const Package({
    required this.name,
    required this.description,
    this.homepage,
    this.repository,
    required this.authors,
    required this.version,
    this.license,
    required this.isMarkdown,
    required this.isSdk,
    required this.dependencies,
  });
}

```

The `Package` class here is defined inside the same file but it's almost identical to [dart_pubspec_licenses](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_pubspec_licenses)'s [Package](https://pub.dev/documentation/dart_pubspec_licenses/2.0.1/dart_pubspec_licenses/Package-class.html) class except it does not have `directory` and `packageYaml` fields.

For a full generated sample, see example code's [oss_licenses.dart](https://github.com/espresso3389/flutter_oss_licenses/blob/master/packages/flutter_oss_licenses/example/lib/oss_licenses.dart).

## Command line options

The following command line generates JSON file instead of dart file:

```shell
flutter pub run flutter_oss_licenses:generate.dart -o licenses.json --json
```

The following table lists the acceptable options:

| Option                        | Abbr. | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output OUTPUT_FILE_PATH`   | `-o`  | Specify output file path. If the file extension is .json, --json option is implied anyway. The default output file path depends on the `--json` flag:<br>with `--json`: `PROJECT_ROOT/assets/oss_licenses.json`<br>without `--json`: `PROJECT_ROOT/lib/oss_licenses.dart` |
| `--project-root PROJECT_ROOT` | `-p`  | Explicitly specify project root directory that contains `pubspec.lock`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--json`                      | `-j`  | Generate JSON file rather than dart file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--help`                      | `-h`  | Show the help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Environment variables

The `bin/generated.dart` uses one or two environment variable(s) depending on your use case:

- `PUB_CACHE` is used to determine package directory.
- `FLUTTER_ROOT` is for Flutter projects only. If not set, Flutter SDK dependencies are simply ignored and not listed.

They are normally set by `dart run` or `flutter pub run`.
